	<center> <h1> Event 1 </h1> </center>
		<p> Worlds is coming up, so none of these changes are particularly aggressive, but we do want to make sure that some of the dominant outliers get tapped down a bit, and some popular picks who have fallen out of favor see some love. Because the stability of this patch is so important, we’re holding back on deeper changes that we’re still investigating, but we’ll be revisiting those champions and items in future patches. <center> <img src="images/events1.jpg" width="800" height="400"> </center> </p>

		<p> We’re also looking at Ornn. We micropatched Ornn twice last patch, and he’s still struggling. We don’t want to overbuff him, so are primarily focusing on his usability, but we’re still monitoring player performance as prospective Ornn mains progress up the mastery curve. <center> <img src="images/events2.jpg" width="800" height="400"> </center> </p>
			
			
	<center> <h1> Event 3 </h1> </center> 		
		<p> We haven’t seen much of the Spellthief’s line since we made Ancient Coin an actually-appealing item earlier in the season. This is less about Coin and more about Spellthief’s: the line just isn’t doing its job of enabling early aggression. We’re moving the cooldown reduction of Frostfang’s upgrades onto Frostfang itself, making it a more potent laning threat. This has the side effect of unlocking more build flexibility: sitting on Frostfang in the midgame will be less punishing for supports who’d rather start building into their late-game oriented items. <center> <img src="images/events3.jpg" width="800" height="400"> </center> </p>
